# Subhunter
A game for the Colour Maximite 2

You are captain of the CMM2, a glorious destroyer.

This is a static screen, single player game.

I am currently devoloping the code, game design and graphics while waiting for my Colour Maximite 2.
Hopefully it arrived end of this month.
But nevertheless, I use the time to develop this little game and learn how this computer works.
learning by doing :-)
