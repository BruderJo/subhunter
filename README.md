# Subhunter
A game for the Colour Maximite 2

<br>

You are captain of the CMM2, a glorious destroyer.

Your orders: Hunt and destroy alle enemy submarines

You control the destroyer ship with your curser keys (left/right)

A water bomb is dropped with \<SPACE>.

The submarines will fire torpedos. Avoid being hit.

This is a static screen, single player game.

I am currently devoloping the code, game design and graphics while waiting for my Colour Maximite 2.
Hopefully it arrived end of this month.
But nevertheless, I use the time to develop this little game and learn how this computer works.

after all those years - basic again :-)
